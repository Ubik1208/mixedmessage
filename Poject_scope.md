#Mixed Message Project#
Project for Codecademy. Supposed to be group project, if I find anyone to join then join, otherwise I continue to work alone

1 create message base - it should have three different piece of data, so I need at least of 3 differen arrays, let saty 10 words/phrases 

every time I run it program should rnadomly choose one phrase from each array and return them joined together.

index of chosen phrase might be find out by Math.floor(Math.random)* n

project scope says about running the program in terminal, but it would be cool to create some simple html interface

to do:

find a team mate
set up repository at github
work on project plan // split work into small pieces
share the work
